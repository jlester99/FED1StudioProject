                    We are Stella Thompson and Alexandria Prince, and together, we started Pawsitive Vibes K9 Trainers Academy based on the principle that every dog deserves a chance to be the best they can be.  We share a passion for dogs and believe there are many great aspects to each one that may never be explored beyond the physical traits and environment for which they are subjected to, good or bad.  With the desire to help dogs be accepted and loved, we spent coutnless hours researching ways to make it happen. We discovered this could best be achieved with the Certified Dog Training Program licensed by the state of Missouri.  From this, we set out to accomplish this goal by opening this well-rounded training facility to provide the skills and knowledge needed to educate the professionals a dog owner can turn to - Certified Dog Trainers.  Our CDP program strives to produce the best dog trainers possible by providing them with the best up-to-date education in the industry, thereby, giving dogs are fighting chance to be the best they can be!

                <p>
                    We have a training facility that we are very proud of which is housed on 3 acres of beautiful private, scenic land.  Our facility and land works well for all indoor and outdoor training needs.  Our class sizes are small so you will get one-on-one attention from the instuctor. We work with area shelters that provide the dogs of various breeds to use for our hands-on, cruelty-free positive-reinforcement training.  You never know what to expect and what challenge you will face with each dog. What a great way to give our students the same type of experience they would encounter in the real world when training dogs!<br />
                    Call us today to set up a free guided tour of the campus and to discuss our program further! <br />
